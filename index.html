  <h3>What is Scrum?</h3>
  <p>Scrum is a way for teams to work on a project or product. The Scrum methodology enables for 
    teams to come up with an idea of how to work on a project, try it out, reflect on the 
    experience, and make appropriate adjustments. In this way, Scrum encourages teams to 
    learn through experiences and continuously improve their work.
